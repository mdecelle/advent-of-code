# Advent of Code Puzzles

This houses solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems. Every puzzle part has a main method named `solution` which takes a filename as an input. The `runner.py` script runs a puzzle solution by changing the name of the import. The file to be run in the solution is sent as a command line argument to the runner.
